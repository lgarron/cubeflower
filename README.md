## Revisions

| Series | Features| Ease of printing |
|-|-|-|
| `v0.1.x` | Thicker walls, taller | Easy|
| `v0.2.x` | Thinner walls, minimal height | More challenging |

For now, consider printing [v0.1.6](https://github.com/lgarron/cubeflower/blob/v0.1.6/cube-box-v0.1.6.scad.3mf) before trying to print any `v0.2.x` version.

`v0.2.x` trades off carrying size for more reliance on material strength and printer tolerances. I personally get my best results with [Burgundy PLA-CF](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-cf) on a [Bambu Lab X1 Carbon](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon).
